Transfer Learning for High-Dimensional Linear and Generalized Linear Models
This document provides comprehensive notes on applying transfer learning in high-dimensional settings, particularly focusing on linear and generalized linear models (GLMs). It introduces algorithms and theoretical analysis aimed at improving the estimation accuracy of models when transferring information from auxiliary source datasets to a target dataset.

Key Topics:
High-Dimensional Regression Models: Explores the challenges of performing linear regression when the number of features (p) exceeds the sample size (n), and highlights how sparsity assumptions can help in model estimation.
Transfer Learning in High Dimensions: The document describes methods for transferring useful information from multiple auxiliary datasets (sources) to improve the estimation of a target model. These methods are particularly effective when there is some similarity between the source and target datasets.
Trans-Lasso Algorithm: Introduces the Trans-Lasso algorithm, which leverages sparsity to transfer information effectively from auxiliary sources to the target. This method is demonstrated to improve the prediction of the target model.
Oracle and Aggregated Approaches: Different approaches to transfer learning are discussed, including the Oracle Trans-Lasso and Aggregated Lasso methods, along with their theoretical guarantees.
Negative Transfer and Source Detection: The document explains how transferring information from unrelated sources can negatively impact model performance and proposes methods for detecting and excluding uninformative sources.
Generalized Linear Models (GLMs): Extends transfer learning techniques to GLMs, covering a variety of response distributions (e.g., logistic, Poisson) and exploring how to construct confidence intervals using these models.
Applications:
Simulation Studies: The notes include various simulation experiments to demonstrate the performance of transfer learning methods in high-dimensional settings, comparing their accuracy and efficiency against traditional methods such as Lasso.
Confidence Intervals: Discusses techniques for constructing confidence intervals in high-dimensional regression problems, which are essential for inference in real-world applications.
