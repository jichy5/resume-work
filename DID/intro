DID Methodology in Federated Learning
This document presents an in-depth exploration of Difference-in-Differences (DID) methods combined with federated learning approaches, particularly focusing on causal inference techniques across multiple datasets without sharing individual-level data. It covers advanced methods for estimating average treatment effects (ATE) and treatment effects on the treated (ATT) using models such as IPW-MLE and AIPW.

Key Topics:
Federated Causal Learning: Methods for analyzing treatment effects across different environments while preserving privacy.
DID in Federated Systems: Application of DID with variation in treatment timing and heterogeneous treatment effects across datasets.
Advanced Estimators: Introduction to AIPW-DID, DRDID, and RIPW methods for more robust and flexible causal inference.
This guide is designed for researchers working with federated data and seeking advanced causal analysis methods for policy evaluation and treatment effect estimation.

This brief overview highlights the core concepts of the document, providing readers with a quick understanding of its purpose and contents.
