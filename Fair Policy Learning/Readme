Fair Policy Learning for Welfare and Health Programs
This document presents a framework for designing fair and efficient policy targeting rules in welfare and health programs. It focuses on constructing treatment allocation rules based on experimental or quasi-experimental data, balancing efficiency and fairness in decision-making.

Key Features:
Fair Policy Targeting: The paper introduces a methodology for creating treatment rules that are Pareto optimal and fair, ensuring that improving the welfare of one sensitive group does not come at the expense of another group.
Decision Framework: The framework allows policymakers to define their fairness criteria and preferences, incorporating legal or ethical constraints. It also guarantees Pareto efficiency in policy selection.
Pareto Frontier Construction: The set of Pareto-optimal policies is identified by maximizing a weighted average of the welfares of sensitive groups, with the relative importance of each group determined by the chosen fairness criteria.
Mixed-Integer Quadratic Program (MIQP): Optimization is performed using MIQP to estimate the optimal policy assignment, ensuring fair treatment allocations while considering the sensitive attributes and individual characteristics.
